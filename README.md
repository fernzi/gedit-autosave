Gedit Autosave Plugin
=====================

Usage
-----

When activated, this plugin will automatically save your current

Saving occurs ~2 seconds after you stop typing. The plugin doesn't
attempt to save read-only or untitled documents.

Installation
------------

Download the [ZIP][1], and extract on your plugin directory, usually located
at `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/`, or clone the repository using `git`:

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/franz-mokka/gedit-autosave.git
```

Afterwards, restart Gedit and activate the plugin from the preferences
dialog.
